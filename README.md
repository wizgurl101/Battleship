## About the project
This is a desktop application that let user play a game of battleship on their deskop.
This was developed in Java and use the Java Swing library to build GUI.

## Application Features
- Chatroom to allow text communication between 2 players during the game
- User able to move ships around the board

## What have I learnt from this project
- Implementing the observer pattern
- basic networking concept using Java net library such as socket
- Applying OOP concepts such as inhertiance
- Using Java Swing library to make GUI

## Future improvements
- Application cannot enforce player turns so this basically reduce the game to a battle of who can click fast enough on their oppenent board
- GUI can be refactor to make it more re-usable
