## About the project
This is a desktop application that let user play a game of battleship with another user on the same network, in addition to providing a chatroom feature.
This was developed in Java and use Eclipse as the IDE.

## Application Features
- Chatroom to allow text communication between 2 players during the game
- User able to move ships around the board by mouse click
- User can play a game of battleship with another user
- Server log application activity

## What have I learnt from this project
- Implementing the observer pattern
- Using Java net library such as socket, to establish connection over a network
- How to design and implement classes according to OOP paradigm
- Using Java Swing library to make GUI and using 2D arrays :D

## Possible Future improvements
- Application does not enforce player turns so this basically reduce the game to a battle of who can click the fastest on all the tiles on their target board
- GUI can be refactor to make it more re-usable
- Refactor code on re-painting the ships on the board
- Make the GUI responsive
- Let user change the ship orientation

## Instructions if you want to play ;D
Download both jar files and make sure they are in the same directory
- Click on server driver jar file to start the server
- Then click the game by clicking the client driver jar file
- You need to click the client jar again to open a second window
